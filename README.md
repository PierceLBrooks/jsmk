jsmk is yet-another build system. This one is based on nodejs and can be used to build / compile complex projects in today's common languages and deployment modalities.

### This repo holds the jsmk build system ###

* Requires nodejs
* This is a work in progress

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone this repo
* Make sure nodejs is installed and in your path
* We are currently using extra modules - installed under node_modules.
** minimist (arg parsing)
** winston (loggin)
** xregexp 
* Make sure jsmk can find configuration settings
** you'll probably want to augment the ones present in _Config.jsmk
